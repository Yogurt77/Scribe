# Scribe
A web HCR application based on an automatic artifical intelligence system to optimize indexing of the Italian civil registration
<br><br>
<b>Summary</b>
<br>
In the last decades there have been thousands of Italian volunteers involved in the project 
of indexing old civil Italian documents from the various city, churches, and locations throughout the country. 
Those documents include birth, marriage, death and others certificates. They all contain information about 
our ancestors who lived in Italy or moved abroad and had a strong influence in our lives. 
They are all gone now but their names and stories are still collected in those documents. 
It’s exciting to learn more about our fathers and mothers by study their life, their suffering, and their joy. 
By studying their life, I end up knowing and loving them better, but I also know myself better too. Indeed, 
family is the most important part of our history.

<b>Web App</b>
<br>
Scribe is a website where the volunteers can login and load documents from the family search website (familysearch.org), 
search for the scribe OCR model and get the information they are looking for on editable text. 
In case the model doesn’t seem correspond to the reality or has a low accuracy, the volunteer can either start to create a completely 
new dataset, modify and improve an existing one (in case he is the owner) or starting a new one from the present dataset. 
The process of creating a dataset consist of making the segmentation of the words and letters, annotating them and asking for 
a computational model request. The system will return a tuned trained model and the volunteer can check its accuracy of the page straight 
away by reading the plain text and comparing it with the original one.
